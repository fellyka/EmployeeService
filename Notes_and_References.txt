* Status Code:
  204 is return when the return type of a method is a void as in:

       public void Post ([FromBody]Employee employee)
        {
            using (EmployeeDBEntities entities = new EmployeeDBEntities())
            {
                entities.Employees.Add(employee);
                entities.SaveChanges();
            }
        }//end of Post method with a 204 No Content HttpStatus Code
   204 returns No Content even if there is contents. According to REST requirements, A method that has got
   items should return 201 Created.
   An hypothetical solution would be to write the Post method as follows:
       
        public HttpResponseMessage Post ([FromBody]Employee employee)
        {
            try
            {
                using (EmployeeDBEntities entities = new EmployeeDBEntities())
                {
                    entities.Employees.Add(employee);
                    entities.SaveChanges();

                    var message = Request.CreateResponse(HttpStatusCode.Created, employee);
                    //URI location of the newly created item including its id
                    message.Headers.Location = new Uri(Request.RequestUri + employee.ID.ToString());

                    return message;
                }

            }

            catch(Exception ex)
            {
               return  Request.CreateErrorResponse(HttpStatusCode.BadRequest, ex);

            }
           
        }//end of enhanced Post method returning 201 HttpStatusCode
